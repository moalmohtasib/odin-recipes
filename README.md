# odin-recipes
The "odin-recipes" is a basic website project that I am working on as part of my learning journey with The Odin Project. The project aims to help me practice and demonstrate my HTML skills by creating a simple website that showcases a collection of recipes.

Throughout this project, I will learn and demonstrate the following skills,creating HTML pages and structuring them using semantic tags, and adding images and other multimedia elements to my web pages. In the future i will be style it up with CSS.

By completing this project, I will gain hands-on experience in building a basic website from scratch using HTML. This project will also help me build my problem-solving skills and attention to detail, which are essential for any programming task.
