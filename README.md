# odin-recipes
The "odin-recipes" is a project aimed at creating a basic recipe website as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The project involves building a basic recipe website to practice HTML skills. The primary purpose of the project is to strengthen my HTML skills, with plans to revisit and style the website with CSS later on.
