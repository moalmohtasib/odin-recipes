    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped spinach, cooked and drained</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.</li>
      <li>In a bowl, mix together the feta cheese, spinach, garlic, salt, and black pepper.</li>
      <li>Using a sharp knife, make a pocket in the thickest part of each chicken breast, being careful not to cut through the other side. Stuff each chicken breast with the spinach and feta mixture, using toothpicks to secure the opening if needed.</li>
      <li>Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add the stuffed chicken breasts and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned.</li>
      <li>Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the middle.</li>
      <li>Remove the toothpicks and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
