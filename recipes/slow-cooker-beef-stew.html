      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>4 carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>2 celery stalks, sliced</li>
      <li>1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes, undrained</li>

      <li>In a shallow dish, season the flour with salt and pepper. Dredge the beef cubes in the flour mixture and shake off any excess.</li>

      <li>Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours, or until the beef is tender and the vegetables are cooked through.</li>
      <li>Add the potatoes and frozen peas to the slow cooker and stir to combine. Cover and continue cooking on low for an additional 1-2 hours, or until the potatoes are tender.</li>
      <li>Season with additional salt and pepper to taste, if needed. Serve hot.</li>
